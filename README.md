# SteamFamilyShare

###### This program allows you to play the same game from your friend's library at the same time, but offline.
###### To use this program, you will probably need to completely close the Steam application and reopen it after disabling network access for Steam.

#### How it works:

1. The program creates a rule in your firewall settings for steam.exe
2. You can enable/disable the rule.

#### In firewall:
###### disable rule = network connection
###### enable rule = no network connection

#### In App:
###### Enable network = network connection
###### Disable Network = no network connection
